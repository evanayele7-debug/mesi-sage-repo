        later, it is played in 172 countries. In this exhibit, curators from Salar Jung Museum, Hyderabad take us on a
        tour of the story of chess.Legend says that the demon king Ravana'a wife Mandodori introduced chess to him for
        stopping him to go to war. Chess was known as Chaturanga . In the later centuries chess became popular in the
        Muslim countries and the term 'Shah Maat' or chekmate became popular.</p>
